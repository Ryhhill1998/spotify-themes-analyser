[Verse 1]
I don't want to be another memory
I want to be a haunting reminder
Of what we could have been, of what we should have been
Like it's always lurking behind you
Maybe tonight, I'll go for a drive and hold
On to the wheel a little tighter
I wish I had a smoke, 'cause I just like the look
Of a flame dancing on a lighter

[Verse 2]
Just to feel something real, I let go of the wheel
Put my life in the hands of two tonnes of steel
On an empty road in the middle of the night
Snapping out of this is harder than I ever realized
Guess I'd better say my goodbyеs

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to waste your time
Likе you waste mine, like yours is worth
More than anyone else's
Why'd you have to light a match and burn it all down into ashes?
And what did we learn from what we'd said?
That it ain't over 'til we're dead
But in the end you ain't worth shit
And I'll never forget it

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never forget it
I'll never forget it
I'll never forget it
I'll never forget it

[Bridge]
I roll the window down, let the breeze run in
Let the wind blow out my cigarette
As the city sounds all but fade away
All that's left is a dark obscurity

[Verse 3]
All I ever need is a simple thing
I want to be in the seat right beside her
So when we careen off of the road and bleed
In each other's arms, we'll be kinder
Kinder than we were before we got so cold
And held the wheel a little tighter
I know you need a smoke but the blood has soaked
Into our clothes and wet the lighter
Guess I'd better say my goodbyes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to waste your time
Like you waste mine, like yours is worth
More than anyone else's
Why'd you have to light a match and burn it all down into ashes?
And what did we learn from what we'd said?
That it ain't over 'til we're dead
But in the end you ain't worth shit
And I'll never forget it
